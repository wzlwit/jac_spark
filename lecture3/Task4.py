# Task 4
# Objective: Broadcast variables and counters

# Broadcast variables:

# Objects which will be cached on each executor in deserialized form.

# How to broadcast:
bcast_var = sc.broadcast(5)

# How to access: (in every Executors)
bcast_var.value

#* Note: We canâ€™t broadcast an RDD or DF.
	#* However, we can collect an RDD as Map using collectAsMap action and broadcast it 

result = rdd1.map(lambda x: (x[0],x[1])).collectAsMap()
sc.broadcast(result)

#* Use case: Map side join or lookup functionality (small table is broacast/duplicated into each)

# Accumulators:

# Helps to aggregate across all executors.

# Initialize:
cntr = sc.accumulator(0)

# Aggregate on executors: (each executor do a accumulation)
cntr.add(1)

# Read on driver: (driver will aggregates all the change and then read, it can only read)
cntr.value

# Note: supported data types should be added through associative and commutative operation. Can be incremented by executors but only be read by driver.
# 	Try creating an accumulator for string data.

#* Use case: Implement counters across different stages like in MapReduce program
