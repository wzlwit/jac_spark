Applying a series of techniques intended to induce 
detect and isolate lethal and or sterile temperature-sensitive mutants
specific to the self-fertilizing hermaphrodite nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
Bergerac strain, 25 such mutants have been found.  
Optimal conditions for the application of mutagenic treatment 
and the detection of such mutations are discussed
