Applying a series techniques intended hermaphrodite nematode to induce 
detect and isolate series techniques and or sterile temperature-sensitive mutants
specific to the self-fertilizing hermaphrodite nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
Bergerac strain, series techniques mutants have been found.  
Optimal conditions for the application hermaphrodite nematode of mutagenic treatment 
and the detection of such mutations are discussed
